# Web-Design-Challenge

## In this activity, I created a html webpage and published data collected from the OpenWeatherAPI, and previously analyzed using Matplotlib to generate plots of Latitude versus different factors such as cloudiness, maximum temperature, humidity and wind speed. 

## The webpage allows the user to navigate between the homepage, plots, visualizations and data. 
### Homepage: General description of the data presented in on the site. The user can click on the various plots to enlarge them and read the descriptions.
### Plots: The user can view individual pages for each plot by clicking the options in the "Plots" menu on the top right
### Visualizations: The user can view the larger plots in a 2x2 grid, and click on each plot to go directly to the plot's page
### Data: The data set is available in a table format on this page
